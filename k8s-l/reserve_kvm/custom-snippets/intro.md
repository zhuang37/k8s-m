::: {.cell .markdown}

Before you run this experiment, you will:

* define the specific configuration of resources you need.
* "instantiate" an experiment with your reserved resources.
* wait for your resources to be configured.
* log in to resources to carry out the experiment.

This exercise will guide you through those steps.
